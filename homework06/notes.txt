~~~~~BigInt.java~~~~~

BigInt java class exists; cannot use it; program will replicate it. 

Used to add an arbitrarily long integer and use it to do operations
however, arbitrarily long number can only be used in program if 
represented by string. 

i.e "12343210957409123097412341203947123049712" + 11

Need to convert 11 to string, but adding will result in string concatenation. 

Method to replicate carrying in addition. Can convert chunks of long number 
as string to integer and use indexes to perform operations.
