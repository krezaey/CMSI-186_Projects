-need ball class to keep track of ball state
-need clock class to keep track of tick ( can use clock class from homework03 ) 
-need to detect collisions
-arguments consist of x, y, x movement, y movement
-ball radius is 4.45 inches, if distance between two centers is <= 8.9 inches, use pythagorean theorem, it is collision
-if ball goes out of bounds, it is no longer a part of the simulation
-simulation stops when collision detected, report the earliest time when the balls collide
-use (mod 4) - 1 to validate arguments, balls must defined by groups of 4, last argument is an optional argument
-multiply by 0,99 per tick to account for friction
-need to have stationary object
