Prereqs of the program:
	-need to have stationary object
	-arguments consist of x, y, x movement, y movement

Goals of the program:
	-need to detect collisions
	-if ball goes out of bounds, it is no longer a part of the         	simulation
	-simulation stops when collision detected, report the earliest 	time when the balls collide

Tips for designing: 
	-ball radius is 4.45 inches, if distance between two centers is 	<= 8.9 inches, use pythagorean theorem, it is collision
	-use (mod 4) - 1 to validate arguments, balls must defined by 		groups of 4, last argument is an optional argument
	-multiply by 0.99 per tick to account for friction
