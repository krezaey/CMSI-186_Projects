~~~~~DynamicChangeMaker.java~~~~~

Our program will return the optimal way of making change. 

java DynamicChangeMaker 2,3,5,7,14,23 173
    -string class method to parse these commas

The first arguments are our coin denominations in our arbitary currency separated by comma.
We need to know: how to make 173 cents out of these denominations, if possible, using the
smallest amount of coins if possible? This is the last argument separated by space. 

NOT BEST WAY:
    - first take the biggest denomination and fill in the gaps
    - however, denomination arguments may not be in increasing order
    - should create method to sort them

BETTER: use dynamic programming!
    - create a table that has a potential solution in each cell
    - use a tuple (use integer miniture tuples, which are like mini lists)
        - tuples have specific names based on how many elements they have
    - number of columns = desired value + 1 ( to account for 0 )
    - number of rows = denominations
        - ex: java DynamicChangeMaker 2, 3 5
        
            5 cents | 0       | 1        | 2        | 3        | 4        | 5        |
     ---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
            { 2 }   | {0 , 0} | IMP      | {1 , 0}  | {1 , 0}  | {1 , 0}  | {1, 0}   |
                    |         | IMP      | {0 , 0}  | IMP      | {1 , 0}  | IMP      |
     adding result  |         | IMP      | {1 , 0}  | IMP      | {2 , 0}  | IMP      |
     ---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------
             { 3 }  | {0 , 0} | IMP      | IMP      | {0 , 1}  | {0 , 1}  | {0 , 1}  |
                    |         | IMP      | IMP      | {0 , 0}  | IMP      | {1 , 0}  |
     adding result  |         | IMP      | {1 , 0 } | {0 , 1}  | {2 , 0}  | {1 , 1}  | <<<<<<<<< SOLUTION


    USING THE TUPLE CLASS
        - have different constructors
            - one will take in an integer and create a tuple of size integer; all elements will be 0
            - one will take in an integer array and use values to create tuple

GENERAL PROGRAM TIPS
    - use the .split(",") method to remove commas
    - validate arguments, no zeros, duplicates, negative numbers, or letters
    - parse as integers in try, say in catch that it cannot work
    - makeChangeWithDynamicProgramming()
        - public static Tuple makeChangeWithDynamicProgramming( int[] denom, int target ) {}
    - do not sort the denomination coins in order
    - two dimensional array of tuple objects
        - Tuple[][] table = new Tuple[ rows ][ columns ]
    - when looking back, it is adding solutions
    - when looking up, it is comparing solutions, if better solution above, use better solution
    - always go back number you're working with, the last number in tuple
