~~~~~DynamicChangeMaker.java~~~~~

Our program will return the optimal way of making change. 

java DynamicChangeMaker 2,3,5,7,14,23 173
    -string class method to parse these commas

The first arguments are our coin denominations in our arbitary currency separated by comma.
We need to know: how to make 173 cents out of these denominations, if possible, using the
smallest amount of coins if possible? This is the last argument separated by space. 

NOT BEST WAY:
    - first take the biggest denomination and fill in the gaps
    - however, denomination arguments may not be in increasing order
    - should create method to sort them

BETTER: use dynamic programming!
    - create a table that has a potential solution in each cell
    - use a tuple (use integer miniture tuples, which are like mini lists)
        - tuples have specific names based on how many elements they have

    USING THE TUPLE CLASS
        - have different constructors
            - one will take in an integer and create a tuple of size integer; all elements will be 0
            - one will take in an integer array and use values to create tuple
